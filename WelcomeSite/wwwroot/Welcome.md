# Welcome!

I'm very proud to be joining the team!  My name is Payton Byrd and I built this site to introduce myself.

What you'll find here is some links to me on the web so you can learn more about my philosophies on programming,
as well as a survey to help me get to know you.

Thanks for checking out this site, which you can also [find on GitHub](https://github.com/sharpninja/welcome-site)!
